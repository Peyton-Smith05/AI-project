FEN Notation:

* / : indicate next rank
* numerical value 1-9 : indicates number of empty squares between pieces
* w | b : indicates turn
* - : indicates filler for notation in western chess
* second to last value is number of half moves since last capture (if reaches 60 game ends in draw)
* last value is number of full moves (full move means increments after both white and black move)

* Upper Case for White, Lower case for black
    * King/General: K/k
